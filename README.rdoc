= d3.layout.no_collision_force

version: 0.0.1


== Introduction:

This is a plugin for d3.layout.force, which is a network layout implemented by force-directed algorithm.
This js provides a feature to avoid collision while force-directed layout.

== How to use:

1. has dependency on a quadtree.js which is hosted at https://github.com/mikechambers/ExamplesByMesh/tree/master/JavaScript/QuadTree
2. replace
        var force = d3.layout.force()
with
        function redraw(layout_for){
                if(layout_for === "rect"){
                    svg.selectAll(element_type)
                            .attr("x", function(d) { return d.x; })
                            .attr("y", function(d) { return d.y; });
                }
                else{
                    svg.selectAll(element_type)
                            .attr("cx", function(d) { return d.x; })
                            .attr("cy", function(d) { return d.y; });
                }
            };
        var force = d3.layout.no_collision_force({
                    layout_for:"rect",
                    maxDepth:5,
                    maxChildren:5,
                    redrawCallback:redraw
                })

layout_for: "rect" or "circle". when in collision, rect will move horizontally/vertically, circle will move radially to avoid.

maxDepth: param for quadtree

maxChildren: param for quadtree

redrawCallback: it's called after avoid-collision movement of each tick, to draw updated positions


== Inspired by this work:

However, its implementation is not quite right, because it tries to detect collision using the d3 quadtree which doesn't support
dimensioned shape (only support points without dimension).
